        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Oak Ridge, TN and Princeton, NJ and currently live in Los Angeles, CA. For the last two and half years, I have been working on a global peace initiative with filmmaker David Lynch and his nonprofit. Before that, I worked with an urban education nonprofit in Newark, NJ helping expand equal opportunity through high quality education.</p>
        <p>As a musician, I have worked and collaborated with a variety of artists and media outlets ranging from Animal Collective to Vogue Paris. I have performed at festivals like All Tomorrow's Parties UK, Sasquatch!, and Midi Festival in France and at venues like J. Paul Getty Museum and Bowery Ballroom NYC. I have also had artwork hosted by spaces such as Big Medium Gallery in Austin, TX and The Hunter Museum of American Art in Chattanooga, TN.</p>
        <p>I've been tinkering with different types of code - HTML, CSS, Pure Data, and a little Javascript - for years and am really excited and eager to put my full attention on becoming an expert web developer. In addition to eventually building cool, interactive websites, I hope to one day create tools that help empower and educate people through digital technology.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>In 2016, I plan to become an expert in: </p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>AngularJS</li>
          <li>Node.js</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Eventually, I’d like to work for a web design firm helping clients fully realize their brand potential online. I hope to be able to volunteer my skills to nonprofits, family and friends who need help creating websites. I also want to learn to build applications with Javascript to help existing systems in the workplace become more effective, efficient and fun.</p>
